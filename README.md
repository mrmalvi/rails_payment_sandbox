# RailsPaymentSandbox

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_payment_sandbox.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails_payment_sandbox)

RailsPaymentSandbox simulates multiple payment gateways locally with fake transactions for **development and testing** purposes.
It saves developers from needing real API keys, sandbox accounts, or actual money movement when testing payment flows.

## Usage

require "rails_payment_sandbox"

# Create a new sandbox payment (random status)
payment = RailsPaymentSandbox::Gateway.new(
  gateway: :stripe,
  amount: 1000,          # amount in smallest unit (e.g. paise for INR)
  currency: "INR"
)

result = payment.process

puts result
# {
#   gateway: :stripe,
#   order_id: "ORD-1696212345-4821",
#   transaction_id: "STR-1696212345-4821",
#   amount: 1000,
#   currency: "INR",
#   status: :success,
#   message: "Stripe payment completed successfully"
# }
```

---

### Force a Specific Status

payment = RailsPaymentSandbox::Gateway.new(
  gateway: :razorpay,
  amount: 500,
  status: :failed
)

# => { gateway: :razorpay, status: :failed, message: "Razorpay payment failed", ... }
```

### Provide a Custom Order ID

```ruby
payment = RailsPaymentSandbox::Gateway.new(
  gateway: :paypal,
  amount: 1500,
